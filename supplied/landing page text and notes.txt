Save the Potholes

Our mission is to preserve and protect the fragile pothole ecosystem. In addition to providing essential habitat for traffic cones and migratory hubcaps, we believe the underappreciated beauty of potholes add texture to all our lives. Can you imagine a world without potholes?

Join us for our 17th annual hole spotting tour!
April 1, 2019 from 4:00 - 6:00 pm
We will meet at the Quartzite Rock Association for a brief presentation from our founder, and tour as a group from there. Neck braces will be available for those who need them. A great time for adventurous people of all ages.
